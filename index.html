    <h1>FRIENDS</h1>
    <h4>This page is designed by:Triveni</h4>
    <p>A friend is often someone that you share a bond with. You may share some common beliefs and values with friends, and often, a friend is someone you trust and enjoy being around. Friends can be in person or online and can vary in distance. You might have a next-door neighbor friend, or a friend thousands of miles away.</p>
    <P>Some friends may be casual; you may talk sometimes and enjoy each otherâ€™s company, but the connection may not be very strong. With close friends, you may feel more deeply connected and like you can rely on them for support. You may be able to talk and laugh easily and share openly. This friendship may feel very reliable, and this friend may make it easy to pick up where you left off. Good friendships and good friends can often stand the test of time. These relationships are often made from mutual respect and care for each other's well-being. </P>
